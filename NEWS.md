# v0.1.0 (2019-05-25)

* Using MCBook2019.bib file instead of biblio.tex.
  This change will allow us to use JabRef (on PCs) or BibDesk (on macOS) to manipulate the bibliography file
* Got natbib working correctly.
* Now using .Rnw files in preparation for adding ggplot graphing capabilities in R at a later date.
